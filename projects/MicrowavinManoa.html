<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.</p>

<h3 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h3>
<p>We created a web application, Microwavin Manoa, to allow for students to learn and share recipes using ingredients within walking distance that can be made using minimal kitchen facilities. These recipes can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc). Users are also able to view the cost per serving based on prices of ingredients within the database. 
Microwavin Manoaâ€™s GitHub page can be viewed <a href="https://microwavin-manoa.github.io/">here</a>, while the deployment can be viewed <a href="https://microwavinmanoa.me/#/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my-contributions">My Contributions</h3>
<p>Microwavin Manoa was created as my final project in ICS314. It was made in collaboration with <a href="https://carolwong492.github.io/">Carol Wong</a>, <a href="https://kaileehung.github.io/">Kailee Hung</a>, and <a href="https://kristyn-mimura.github.io/">Kristyn Mimura</a>. We created Microwavin Manoa using Meteor, Semantic UI, React, and Uniforms. My team met in person twice a week and called on the weekends in order to work on the project. By meeting so frequently, we were able to address any issues others had and manage our tasks.</p>

<p>On the backend, I helped to create initial collections and initial pages as well as implement functionality on the site on different pages such as Edit Ingredient for admin. On the frontend, I worked to design the website by designing different pages such as the Add Recipe page. Additionally, I deployed the website using Digital Ocean and managed updating data through Studio 3T.</p>

<h3 id="my-experience">My Experience</h3>

<p>Working on Microwavin Manoa gave me a taste of what it means to be a software engineer. I learned how to effectively and efficiently collaborate with a team using tools such as GitHub. On top of that, I learned how to work with Mongo collections and use frameworks as well as functional programming to handle data.</p>
